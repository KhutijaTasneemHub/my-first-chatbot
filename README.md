Importing libraries (tools that python program needs) 
**import streamlit as st**
**What it does**: Loads the Streamlit library, which lets you create web apps using Python.
**In simple terms:** Think of Streamlit as the “website builder” for your chatbot. Instead of writing HTML and CSS, you just write Python code, and Streamlit turns it into a webpage automatically.
**Example:** If you want a text box on your web page, Streamlit can create it with one line of code.

**from PyPDF2 import PdfReader**
**What it does:** Imports the PdfReader tool from the PyPDF2 library, which allows your code to read PDF files and extract text from them.
**Example: **If you upload a 10-page PDF, PdfReader can read every page and give you the words inside it, just like reading a book and copying text.
